#
# Notes:
#    This file contains the freevo settings. To change the settings
#    you can edit this file, or better, put a file named local_conf.py
#    # in the same directory and add your changes there.  E.g.: when
#    you # want a alsa as mplayer audio out, just put
#    "MPLAYER_AO_DEV = # 'alsa9'" in local_conf.py
#
#    This file has the format::
#
#        # Note line 1
#        # Note line 2
#        # Note line n
#        VAR = 'default value' # tool tip text
#
# How config files are loaded:
#
# [$freevo-bindir/ is the directory where the freevo start-script is
# located (i.e. the "shipping copy dir"). This can be any directory, e.g.
# the download directory or /usr/local]
#
# [$cwd/ is the directory the user started freevo from. This can be
# $freevo-bindir/, or any other directory]
#
# 1) freevo.conf is not shipped, but it is required and must be generated
# using ./configure before freevo can be used.
#
# 2) freevo.conf is searched for in ['$cwd/', '~/.freevo/',
# '/etc/freevo/', $freevo-bindir/]. The first one found is loaded.
#
# 3) freevo_config.py is always loaded from $freevo-bindir/, it is not
# supposed to be changed by the user. It has a format version number in
# the format "MAJOR.MINOR", e.g. "2.3". The version number reflects the
# config file format, *not* the Freevo version number.
#
# 4) local_conf.py is searched for in ['$cwd/', '~/.freevo',
# '/etc/freevo/', $freevo-bindir/]. The first one found is loaded. It is
# not a required file. The search is independent of where freevo.conf was
# found.
#
# 5) The same logic as in 4) applies for local_skin.xml.
#
# 6) The version MAJOR numbers must match in freevo_config.py and
# local_conf.py, otherwise it is an error.
#
# 7) The version MINOR number is used for backwards-compatible changes,
# i.e. when new options are added that have reasonable default values.
#
# 8) A warning is issued if freevo_config.py.MINOR > local_conf.py.MINOR.
#
# 9) It is an error if local_conf.py.MINOR > freevo_config.py.MINOR since
# the user most likely did not intend to use a recent local_conf.py with
# an old Freevo installation.
#
# 10) There is a list of change descriptions in freevo_config.py,
# one per MAJOR.MINOR change. The user is informed of what has
# changed between his local_conf.py and the new freevo_config.py format if
# they differ in version numbers.
#
#
#
# Developer Notes:
#    The CVS log isn't used here. Write changes directly in this file
#    to make it easier for the user. Make alos sure that you insert new
#    options also in local_conf.py.example
#
# Todo:
#    o a nice configure or install script to ask these things
#    o different settings for MPG, AVI, VOB, etc
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Changes:
#    o Generate ROM_DRIVES from /etc/fstab on startup
#    o Added FREEVO_CONF_VERSION and LOCAL_CONF_VERSION to keep the three
#      different files on sync

# xmltv grabber, e.g. the German list doesn't contain station lists. In this
# case Freevo will output the possible list for you to add them manually.
#
# If auto-detection doesn't work or you want to edit the list, run
